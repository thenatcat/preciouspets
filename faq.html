				<details>
						<summary><b>Is your shelter ethical?</b></summary>
						<p>Rest assured we treat our pets with utmost respect and compassion.</p>

						<p>Unlike the irresponsible animal shelters putting animals in crowded shacks
						without proper protection, often leaving them to fend for themselves, we place our
						precious pets in secure, cosy housing where our foster volunteers will
						nurture their growth and maintain their wellbeing.</p>
						<p>Whereas less reputable shelters are irresponsible breeders resorting to puppy mill
						practices, overbreeding, and inhumane treatment, we desex all our pets to avoid
						creating an unwanted overpopulation.</p>
						<p>In terms of euthanasia, we abide by a socially conscious policy so we can promise to help
						every animal in need regardless of their current condition, even when the best
						we can do is a painless release.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
						<summary><b>Are your animals vaccinated?</b></summary>
						<p>We keep our pets up to date with vaccinations to protect their immune system from
						hepatitis, parvovirus, leptospirosis, plus other infections. Not only will they avoid
						suffering the symptoms, these vaccines will boost their overall health.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
						<summary><b>Where do your animals come from?</b></summary>
						<p>Our rescue consists of pets surrendered, abandoned, or abused by their owners, strays
							wondering the streets, or transfers from another shelter.
						</p>
				</details>
				<details>
						<summary><b>How can I support Precious Pets?</b></summary>
						<p>You can apply to be a volunteer or donate some of your money to us through our website.
						On top of those contributions, you can also mail in-kind packages like pet food to the
						physical address at the bottom of our webpages.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
						<summary><b>Where do my donations go towards?</b></summary>
						<p>As a not-for-profit without government funding, we rely on the community on donations
							and fundraisers toward our animal shelter and clinic operations, foster care program,
							outreach and advocacy efforts, and pet rescue service.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
						<summary><b>How do I adopt a pet?</b></summary>
						<p>Send us a message at the email in the website footer, just scroll down the bottom, to register
						your interest in taking in one of our pets. We will get back to you as soon
						as we can to interview you on your suitability, preferences, and responsibilities.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
						<summary><b>What are your requirements for adopting?</b></summary>
						<p>Adopters must be 18 years old or older and live within the Wellington region,
							ensuring we can accessibly check up on our pets. We also take into consideration
							how our pet behaves to your children and current household pets, whether you have
							an open, secure yard, and other potential concerns impacting our pet's experience with you.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
						<summary><b>What are the fees to take in a pet?</b></summary>
						<p>Depending on the age, breed, and size of the pet, fees can go as low as $200 to as high as $900
							out of recouping the costs for rehoming and caring for them. These fees go to microchipping,
							registering, vetting, fostering, and insuring our pets for rehoming.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
						<summary><b>What is the adoption process like?</b></summary>
						<p>Once we confirm you are suited to adopt one of our precious pets, one of our counselors
						will guide you towards choosing the pet who will complement your lifestyle. They will introduce you to the
						animals you are keen on having, leaving you time to play and interact with them to bond with your potential companion.
						Once you have decided, our counselor will walk you through completing the rest of your adoption forms.</p>
				</details>
				<details id="lastquestion">
						<summary><b>What happens if your pets cannot find a home?</b></summary>
						<p>Out pets can stay as long as it takes for them to find a loving home.
						We will not euthanize them except if they are irredemmably sick, injured, or
						are expressing a temperament dangereous to themselves and others. Until then, they will have
						safety and comfort with us.</p>
